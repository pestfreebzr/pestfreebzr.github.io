<p>Pest management requires a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular tracking suggests that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many specific product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in limited areas.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management techniques, a practice called incorporated pest management.
