<p>Pest management requires a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied only after regular tracking suggests that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many specific product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in limited areas.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management techniques, a practice called incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though challenged by some as a legitimate step, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
