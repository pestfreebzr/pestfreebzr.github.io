All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your possessions with poisonous chemicals, ruin the air quality in your house or business, possibly contaminate food and other perishables, and just kills pests at the surface of the problem.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove since growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement.

Our termite control services will deal with and protect your house from any additional damage.
