<p>Biological pest control procedures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary task is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies assists to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control professionals even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>The habits of the pest can be made use of for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and breeding interruption techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When distributed in the field or positioned in traps, baits containing dangerous material will draw in and eliminate the pests.</p>
<p>Pests can end up being a costly issue for your business if delegated their own devices. If further tracking, recognitions and action limits show that less dangerous controls are not working, then additional pest control methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. However good the results of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) may be, it is just reasonable to say that worldwide, its release in agriculture is still in its infancy, and we are a long method from understanding everything that goes on around the crops we grow for food.</p>
