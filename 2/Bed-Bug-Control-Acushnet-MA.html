Special preventative measures must be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic method to pest control.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the concept of integrating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
