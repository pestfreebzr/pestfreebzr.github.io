The historic and more prevalent usage of this term is limited to utilize of natural opponents to handle populations of pest organisms. Some researchers also recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM could happen, even annual management of a continuous pest could be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove because growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan.

<p>Kaolin particle films used in organic farming may control some pests, but can adversely impact natural enemies and trigger other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may motivate natural opponent populations, but a greater number of natural opponents does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling make use of nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have a negative influence on the environment.</p>
