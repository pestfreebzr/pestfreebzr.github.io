<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are selected first, including extremely targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.

Chemical controls were to be applied only after routine tracking showed that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the expense of the control steps.</p>

The majority of pesticide issues are brought on by a small number of the pesticides readily available today. </p>
