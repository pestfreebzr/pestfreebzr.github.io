<p>There are different pest management strategies to suppress pests. Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making process for handling pests in an effective, economical and ecologically sound method.

Boron, a known pesticide can be fertilized into the paper fibers of cellulose insulation at certain levels to accomplish a mechanical kill aspect for self-grooming insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites, and more. A reliable monitoring program will determine what pests are present and how they are going into the facility, and will give insight for the advancement of a preventive program targeted at chosen pest problems.</p>
<p>Pests can end up being a costly problem for your business if delegated their own devices. If additional monitoring, identifications and action limits suggest that less risky controls are not working, then extra pest control approaches would be used, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.

<p>Pest, weed, and illness problems are minimized through natural control by the enriched natural enemy animals, using weed-competitive or disease- and pest-resistant varieties (with a focus on long lasting systems for resistance), decrease of nitrogen fertilization, and cautious use of chemical pest control based upon careful population sampling and choice limits.</p>
