<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are enormous straight to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides.

<p>Farmers and growers have been regularly using a lot of these IPM techniques for years or even generations - strategies such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations vulnerable to pests, or utilizing tolerant or resistant varieties. Sovereign Pest Control and its associated companies supply quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 property owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
