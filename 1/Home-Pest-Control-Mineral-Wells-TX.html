<p>Chemical pest control, especially area fumigation, tends to work best for severe infestations.

<p>Go with the least hazardous (or most affordable schedule) household pesticide offered. Most people generally think of pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to invade their homes and yards, however, pests know no season. A green pest management IPM program uses pesticides originated from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally happening products.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular tracking showed that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the expense of the control procedures.</p>
<p>If, after following organized and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use chosen biopesticides with low ecological impact. Professional exterminators use various kinds of baits and pesticides to kill and eliminate pests. Effective, long-term corrective actions can then be required to prevent pests from getting in the structure and infesting the structure and collections. </p>
