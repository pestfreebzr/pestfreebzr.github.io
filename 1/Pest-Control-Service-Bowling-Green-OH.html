A single identifying of any pest in a storage facility during an audit can imply a great deal of damage to the company-financial and reputation-wise. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your belongings with poisonous chemicals, destroy the air quality in your home or business, possibly infect food and other perishables, and only kills pests at the surface area of the issue.</p>
