CHEMICAL CONTROL OF PEST PEST: Use of artificial chemicals for handling pest population is called chemical control and the chemicals used for this are called insecticides.</p>
<h3>Controlling Cockroaches Eden Prairie Minnesota</h2>
<p>The concept of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for handling pests, has actually remained in practice for a long period of time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also considered a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and more feeding on the saved crop.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses much of the same ideas as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
<p>Biological control includes the use of a pest's natural enemies (e.g., predators, parasitoids, parasites and pathogens), to control pest abundance. The term "IPM," under various authors have actually advocated for the principle of including, the full selection of pest management practices with production goals in a total systemic technique. These control approaches can be cost-effective and very efficient and present little to no risk to people or the environment.</p>
