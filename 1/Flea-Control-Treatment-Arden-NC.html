Termites eat furniture, documents, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, thus triggering colossal damage within simply a few months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer homes and businesses to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes introducing natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a new area where native natural enemies do not supply control.</p>
