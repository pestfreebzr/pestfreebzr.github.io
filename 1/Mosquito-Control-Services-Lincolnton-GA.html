<p>The concept of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for managing pests, has been in practice for a long period of time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt contaminants are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is likewise thought about a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it a minimum of stops their development and additional feeding on the kept crop.</p>
<p>More details is required about food-chain concentration and useful methods of getting rid of destructive results of pesticide residues that might remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their function. Don't base pest management programs on overall elimination of a pest.

What is thought about a good IPM program today might be considered a chemical extensive program in a few years. Use appropriate crop rotation practices and target pests with multiple modes of action to make it harder for pests to adapt.</p>
