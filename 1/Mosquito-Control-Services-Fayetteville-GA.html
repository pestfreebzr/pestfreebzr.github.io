<p>Biological pest control measures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed.

Some termite control specialists even fix structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>If, after following preventive and planned management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low ecological effect. Professional exterminators utilize various kinds of baits and pesticides to kill and remove pests.
