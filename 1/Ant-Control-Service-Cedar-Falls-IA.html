If it was not widely adopted, all nations acknowledged IPM as a desirable method to pest control even. Pests are a major threat that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a waste of time and resources. Biological insecticides, stemmed from naturally occurring bacteria (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic fungis and entomopathogenic nematodes ), also fall in this classification.</p>
<p>For some jobs, pest control employees use a mix of pest management strategies, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, illness, and arthropods, though contested by some as a legitimate measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the intensification of pest control.</p>

<p>It keeps the use of pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and environmentally warranted and reduces dangers to human health and the environment.
