<p>The concept of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for managing pests, has been in practice for a very long time.

Some need long-term contracts that cost $400 or more despite the fact that for most pests, a single treatment succeeded must be enough.

<p>The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" progressed over a period of about 10 years, primarily amongst scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools.

<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a efficient and environmentally sensitive  approach to pest management that depends on a combination of sensible practices. IPM is a technique to make sure economic viability at both consumer and producer level (seller is constantly anticipated to earn a profit), ecological security through a well balanced use of all available pest control choices, and social reputation because IPM-based food is cost effective and safe.</p>

IPM programs preliminary job is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed.
