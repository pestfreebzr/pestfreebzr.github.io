<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a environmentally delicate and reliable method to pest management that depends on a combination of sensible practices.

<p>On the other hand, natural food production applies much of the very same ideas as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
