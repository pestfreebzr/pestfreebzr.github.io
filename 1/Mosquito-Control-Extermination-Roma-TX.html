<p>There is no clear clinical evidence that taking in crop products stemmed from genetically crafted plants has triggered detrimental impacts to human beings or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses contain chymosin, which is, and has been for a long time, produced with genetically crafted bacteria).

<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
